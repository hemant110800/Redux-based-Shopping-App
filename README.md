# Redux-based-Shopping-App
Created a basic shopping app (MERN based), where maintaining some items with price, description and providing Add to Cart Button for each items, based on click we are adding items to cart and updating the count accordingly and based on items selections we are updating the selected item to back-end and retrieving the selected items on need.

App is providing some Favourite Products list, where we can see product details with their price and description and have add to Cart Button, on top header we have **My Cart Button** which contains count value of total items present in cart.
